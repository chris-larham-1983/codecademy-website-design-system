## General Information

This is my solution to the **Codecademy** portfolio project challenge titled '*Build a Website Design System*'.
In this project we had to create a web page that documents the **fonts**, **colors**, and **typography** that we intend 
to employ consistently in our future web design projects.

## Technologies

I used **HTML5** and **CSS3** to implement this *website design system*. I employed a couple of fancy **CSS3** styling 
techniques, including pseudo-classes and radial-gradients.
